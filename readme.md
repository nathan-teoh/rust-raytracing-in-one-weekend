# what is this 

I am going through [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) in order to learn Rust.

# why

I don't know 

# how do i view the photos

I use [this website](https://kylepaulsen.com/stuff/NetpbmViewer/)

# disclaimer

Everything is super alpha / early stage. Yes there are ways I can make the code cleaner and more consistent, but at this point I am more worried about getting it to work, than anything else.

Thanks for coming! xoxo
